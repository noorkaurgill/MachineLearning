    "# Intro\n",
    "---\n",
    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup posts on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish posts by topics inferred from the text. Whereas with digit classification, where each input is relatively **dense** (represented as a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero), here each document is relatively **sparse** (represented as a **bag-of-words**). Only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The assumption is that a label depends only on the count of words, not their order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sklearn` documentation on feature extraction may be useful:\n",
    "http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_extraction.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Each problem can be addressed succinctly with the included packages -- please don't add any more. Grading will be based on writing clean, commented code, along with a few short answers.\n",

    "- Make sure to answer every part in every question.\n",
    " - There are 7 questions and one extra credit question. \n",
    " - Read carefully what is asked including the notes.\n",
    " - Additional points may be deducted if:\n",
    "   - the code is not clean and well commented, \n",

    " ## Requirements:\n",
    "---\n",
    "1. Comment your code.\n",
    "1. All graphs should have titles, label for each axis, and if needed a legend. It should be understandable on its own.\n",
    "1. All code must run on colab.research.google.com\n",
    "1. You should not import any additional libraries.\n",
    "1. Try and minimize the use of the global namespace (meaning keep things in functions).\n",

    "ANSWER: \n",
    "\n",
    "k-Nearest Neighbors doesn't work well for this problem because there are a lot of dimensions and the lack of the distance metric's significance in greater dimensions means that k-Nearest Neighbors suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Moreover, Euclidean distance, which works well in 2-D and 3-D, may not be best suited for this dataset with a large number of dimensions. As per k-NN, closer points are more relevant as opposed to farther points, but if all points are equidistant from each other the distinction does not hold value. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression doesn't work as well as Naive Bayes does because the sample size is small. Although there is a high dimensionality, there is not enough training data, so it would take more examples of dimensionality reduction through something like feature selection in order for the logistic regression model's performance to improve.\n",

    "Observing from the table, cheers kent and sci space have positive and roughly equal weights for alt.atheism and talk.religion.misc. More specifically, cheers kent has a large weight for both. This indicates overlap in the data samples for those 2, which one can dive deeper into. Diving deeper into alt.atheism and talk.religion.misc, they both  don't have terms like 'religion','christain', 'catholic', or other traditionally religious terms associated with them, which is interesting. It was also really in interesting but peculiar how 'the fbi' was a term so frequently associated with religion, which does not make any immediate logical sense."

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. Logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small total size. The default L2 regularization computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (as in Part 3 above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. Whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, **L1 regularization drives many of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features**. For this reason, we can use it as a way to do \"feature selection\".\n",

    "1. For several L1 regularization strengths ...\n",
    "  1. Produce a Logistic Regression model using the **L1** regularization strength.  Reduce the vocabulary to only those features that have at least one non-zero weight among the four categories.\n",
    "  1. Produce a new Logistic Regression model using the reduced vocabulary . For this new model, use an **L2** regularization strength of 0.5.  \n",
    "  1. Evaluate and show the L1 regularization strength, vocabulary size, and f1 score associated with the new model.\n",
    "1. Show a plot of f1 score vs. log vocabulary size.  Each point corresponds to a specific L1 regularization strength used to reduce the vocabulary.\n",
    "1. How does performance of the models based on reduced vocabularies compare to that of a model based on the full vocabulary?\n",

    "* Train on the transformed (i.e. CountVectorizer) training data.\n",

    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., penalty=\"l2\")` to produce a logistic regression model using L2 regularization.\n",
    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., tol=0.015)` to produce a logistic regression model using relaxed gradient descent convergence criteria.  The gradient descent code that trains the logistic regression model sometimes has trouble converging with extreme settings of the C parameter. Relax the convergence criteria by setting tol=.015 (the default is .0001).\n",

    "The performance of the model based on the reduced vocabulary is roughly similar to that of models based on the full vocabulary. It appears that the performance of the models with the full vocabulary increases with increasing C values up to a optimal point with a f1 score high of about 0.6955. On the other hand, the performance of the model with the reduced vocabulary is slightly lower but very close with a f1 score of 0.6875, with a difference of about 0.008 compared to the full vocabulary-based models.
